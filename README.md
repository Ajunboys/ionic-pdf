# ionic-pdf

This repo provides a sample pdf generator that:

 * Uses the pdfMake.org library for generating the pdf
 * Outputs base-64 encoded pdf file data for display in iframe on screen
 * Saves pdf to a local file using cordova File plugin

## pdfMake.org
The [pdfMake.org](http://pdfMake.org) library is based on the pdfKit library and provides a declarative approach to document definition that provides a number of features: columns, tables, images, limited formatting, etc.  The one piece that was missing for my specific use was generic SVG drawings.  So, I made a small edit to allow me to draw a piechart using SVG path commands.  NOTE - the pdfmake.min.js library used in this example contains my edits.
## inline pdf display
To allow the demo to run online and in browser testing, I provide an iframe and base-64 dataURL method to display the pdf inline.  The pdfMake library generates the dataURL using the pdfKit provided method.  My sample assigns this string as the src for the iframe object in the ionic view.
## pdf save to file
To sample the file save method, you will need to run the app in the emulator or device to enable the use of the cordova File plugin.  The app that a pulled this code out of does not use the ngCordova library yet.  But I will eventually port over to match best practices use of plugins w/ Ionic.

And here's some code!

```javascript
$(function(){
  $('div').html('I am a div.');
});
```

Props to Mr. Doob and his [code editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/code-editor/), from which
the inspiration to this, and some handy implementation hints, came.
